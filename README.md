# What Is a Merkle Tree?
A Merkle tree is a data structure that is used in computer science applications. 
In bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, Merkle trees serve to encode blockchain data more efficiently and securely.
The concept of Merkle Tree is named after Ralph Merkle, who patented the idea in 1979. Fundamentally, it is a data structure tree in which every leaf node labelled with the hash of a data block, and the non-leaf node labelled with the cryptographic hash of the labels of its child nodes. The leaf nodes are the lowest node in the tree.
